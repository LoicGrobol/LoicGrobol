### Hi! Bonjour ! Hej! Demat !

I’m Loïc Grobol. I’m a maître de conférence (≈ Associate Professor) in computational linguistics at [Université Paris Nanterre](https://parisnanterre.fr), France 🇫🇷, in the
[MoDyCo](https://modyco.fr) team and associate member of the [Lattice](lattice.cnrs.fr) lab
([CNRS](https://cnrs.fr) and [École Normale Supérieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu)).

I pronounce my name [loic gʁobɔl]. I typically use they/them pronouns in English and gender-neutral pronouns in other languages where they exist.

Most of my work is available here, in the form of publicly released software, courses websites and half-baked ideas. Don't hesitate to reach out if you see something you'd like to discuss.

if you're looking for my academic webpage, it's at <https://loicgrobol.github.io>
