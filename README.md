### Hi! Bonjour ! Hej! Demat !

I’m Loïc Grobol. I’m a maître de conférence (≈ Assistant Professor) in computational linguistics at Université Paris Nanterre, France 🇫🇷, in the MoDyCo team.

I pronounce my name [loic gʁobɔl]. I typically use they/them pronouns in English and gender-neutral pronouns in other languages where they exist.

Most of my work is available here, in the form of publicly released software, courses websites and half-baked ideas. Don't hesitate to reach out if you see something you'd like to discuss.
